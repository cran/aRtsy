\title{aRtsy --- Generative Art using \code{ggplot2}}
\description{
  \if{html}{\figure{logo.png}{options: align='right' alt='logo' width='120'}}

  \code{aRtsy} is an attempt at making generative art available for the masses in a simple and standardized format. 
  The package provides various algorithms for creating artworks in ggplot2 that incorporate some form of 
  randomness (depending on the set \code{seed}). Each type of artwork is implemented in a separate function.

  For documentation on \code{aRtsy} itself, including the manual and user guide
  for the package, worked examples, and other
  tutorial information visit the \href{https://koenderks.github.io/aRtsy/}{package website}.
