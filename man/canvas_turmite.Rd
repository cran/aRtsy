\usage{
canvas_turmite(colors, background = "#fafafa", p = 0, iterations = 1e6,
               resolution = 500, noise = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{colors}{a character specifying the color used for the artwork. The number of colors determines the number of turmites.}

\item{background}{a character specifying the color used for the background.}

\item{p}{a value specifying the probability of a state switch within the turmite.}

\item{iterations}{a positive integer specifying the number of iterations of the algorithm.}

\item{resolution}{resolution of the artwork in pixels per row/column. Increasing the resolution increases the quality of the artwork but also increases the computation time exponentially.}

\item{noise}{logical. Whether to add k-nn noise to the artwork. Note that adding noise increases computation time significantly in large dimensions.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot} object containing the artwork.
}
\description{
This function paints a turmite. A turmite is a Turing machine which has an orientation in addition to a current state and a "tape" that consists of a two-dimensional grid of cells.
}
\details{
The turmite algorithm consists of the following steps: 1) turn on the spot (left, right, up, down) 2) change the color of the square 3) move forward one square.
