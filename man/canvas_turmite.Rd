}
\arguments{
\item{color}{a character specifying the color used for the turmite.}

\item{background}{a character specifying the color used for the background.}

\item{p}{the probability of a state switch within the turmite.}

\item{iterations}{the number of iterations of the turmite.}

\item{height}{the height of the artwork in pixels.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot} object containing the artwork.

\description{
This function paints a turmite. A turmite is a Turing machine which has an orientation in addition to a current state and a "tape" that consists of a two-dimensional grid of cells. The algorithm is simple: 1) turn on the spot (left, right, up, down) 2) change the color of the square 3) move forward one square.
