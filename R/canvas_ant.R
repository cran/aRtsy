#' Draw Langton's Ant
#'
#' @description This function draws Langton's Ant on a canvas. Langton's ant is a two-dimensional universal Turing machine with a very simple set of rules. These simple rules can lead to complex emergent behavior.
#'
#' @usage canvas_ant(colors, background = "#fafafa", iterations = 1000000,
#'            resolution = 500)
#'
#' @param colors      a character (vector) specifying the color(s) used for the artwork.
#' @param background  a character specifying the color used for the background.
#' @param iterations  a positive integer specifying the number of iterations of the algorithm.
#' @param resolution  resolution of the artwork in pixels per row/column. Increasing the resolution increases the quality of the artwork but also increases the computation time exponentially.
#'
#' @return A \code{ggplot} object containing the artwork.
#'
#' @details The algorithm for Langton's Ant involves repeating the following rules: 1) on a non-colored block: turn 90 degrees clockwise, un-color the block, move forward one block; 2)
#'          On a colored block: turn 90 degrees counter-clockwise, color the block, move forward one block; 3) If a certain number of iterations has passed, choose a different color which corresponds to a different combination of these rules.
