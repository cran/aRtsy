#' Draw Gemstones
#'
#' @description This function draws the predictions from a k-nearest neighbors algorithm trained on randomly generated continuous data.
#'
#' @usage canvas_gemstone(colors, n = 1000, resolution = 500)
#'
#' @param colors      a string or character vector specifying the color(s) used for the artwork.
#' @param n           a positive integer specifying the number of random data points to generate.
#' @param resolution  resolution of the artwork in pixels per row/column. Increasing the resolution increases the quality of the artwork but also increases the computation time exponentially.
#'
#' @return A \code{ggplot} object containing the artwork.
