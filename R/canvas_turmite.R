#' Draw Turmites
#'
#' @description This function paints a turmite. A turmite is a Turing machine which has an orientation in addition to a current state and a "tape" that consists of a two-dimensional grid of cells.
#'
#' @usage canvas_turmite(colors, background = "#fafafa", p = 0, iterations = 1e6,
#'                resolution = 500, noise = FALSE)
#'
#' @param colors       a character specifying the color used for the artwork. The number of colors determines the number of turmites.
#' @param background  a character specifying the color used for the background.
#' @param p           a value specifying the probability of a state switch within the turmite.
#' @param iterations  a positive integer specifying the number of iterations of the algorithm.
#' @param resolution  resolution of the artwork in pixels per row/column. Increasing the resolution increases the quality of the artwork but also increases the computation time exponentially.
#' @param noise       logical. Whether to add k-nn noise to the artwork. Note that adding noise increases computation time significantly in large dimensions.
#'
#' @return A \code{ggplot} object containing the artwork.
#'
#' @details The turmite algorithm consists of the following steps: 1) turn on the spot (left, right, up, down) 2) change the color of the square 3) move forward one square.
