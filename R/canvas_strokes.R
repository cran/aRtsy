#' Draw Strokes
#'
#' @description This function creates an artwork that resembles paints strokes. The algorithm is based on the simple idea that each next point on the grid has a chance to take over the color of an adjacent colored point but also has a change of generating a new color.
#'
#' @usage canvas_strokes(colors, neighbors = 1, p = 0.01, iterations = 1,
#'                resolution = 500, side = FALSE)
#'
#' @param colors     a string or character vector specifying the color(s) used for the artwork.
#' @param neighbors  a positive integer specifying the number of neighbors a block considers when taking over a color. More neighbors fades the artwork.
#' @param p          a value specifying the probability of selecting a new color at each block. A higher probability adds more noise to the artwork.
#' @param iterations a positive integer specifying the number of iterations of the algorithm. More iterations generally apply more fade to the artwork.
#' @param resolution resolution of the artwork in pixels per row/column. Increasing the resolution increases the quality of the artwork but also increases the computation time exponentially.
#' @param side       logical. Whether to put the artwork on its side.
#'
#' @return A \code{ggplot} object containing the artwork.
